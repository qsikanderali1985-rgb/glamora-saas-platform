## ⚠️ **MINOR ITEMS** (Acceptable for Sale)

**Status**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Buyers expect this

**Where Used**:

- Chat conversations (3 mock chats)
- Reviews (sample reviews)
- Inventory items (sample products)
- Financial data (sample transactions)

**Why It's OK**:
- ✅ Shows functionality working
- ✅ Professional buyers understand demos
- ✅ Easy to replace with real data
- ✅ Backend integration ready (just needs connection)

**In Flippa Listing, Mention**:
> "App uses demo data for showcase. Complete API layer ready - just connect your backend URL and it works with real data."

### **2. Empty Button Handlers** (8 instances)
**Status**: ⚠️ **MINOR** - Can be fixed in 5 minutes

**Locations**:
1. Home Screen - "See All" button (line 112)
2. Home Screen - Notifications button (line 178)
3. Home Screen - "Home Service" filter (line 257)
4. Owner Dashboard - Profile button (line 172)
5. Owner Dashboard - Settings button (line 176)
6. Owner Dashboard - Staff card action (line 762)

**Impact**: LOW

**Quick Fix**: Add snackbar messages like:
```dart
onPressed: () {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(content: Text('Feature coming soon!')),
  );
}
```

### **3. Backend Not Deployed**
**Status**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Actually BETTER for sale

**Why It's Good**:
- Buyer can choose their own hosting
- More valuable (they get full control)
- Professional buyers prefer this

**In Flippa Listing, Say**:
> "Backend code ready. Deploy to Heroku (FREE) or your preferred cloud in 30 minutes. Complete deployment guide included."
